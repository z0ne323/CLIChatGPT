X:\> How to get an input from user with Ruby ?
CLIChatGPT: To get an input from the user with Ruby, you can use the `gets` method. Here's an example:```puts "What is your name?"name = gets.chompputs "Hello, #{name}!"```In this example, the `puts` method is used to display a message asking for the user's name. The `gets.chomp` method is then used to get the user's input and remove any trailing whitespace. Finally, the user's name is displayed using string interpolation.

X:\> Can you tell me what's the difference between the functions send, puts and write in the context of a socket in Ruby ?
CLIChatGPT: In the context of a socket in Ruby, the functions send, puts, and write are used to send data over the socket connection. However, there are some differences between these functions:1. send: The send function is a low-level function that allows you to send data over the socket connection. It takes a buffer of data as an argument and returns the number of bytes sent. You can also specify additional flags to control the behavior of the send operation.2. puts: The puts function is a higher-level function that is used to send a string of data over the socket connection. It automatically adds a newline character at the end of the string and flushes the output buffer. However, it does not provide as much control over the send operation as the send function.3. write: The write function is similar to the send function, but it is a higher-level function that is used to send a buffer of data over the socket connection. It returns the number of bytes written and also provides some control over the send operation, such as the ability to specify a timeout value.In summary, the send function is the lowest-level function that provides the most control over the send operation, while the puts and write functions are higher-level functions that provide more convenience and ease of use.
