# CLI version of some of OpenAI/ChatGPT capabilities!

Written in `python` thanks to the module of `OpenAI` and of course my `Helpers` module for the API part !

The only requirement for this project is to have an `OpenAI` account with an `API` key.

You'll need to put the `API` key in a file, doesn't really matter where you store it but inside the project is the easiest option.

You have some cool features:

- ChatGPT like but directly in the `CLI`
- The conversation you have is logged with a `normal` file and a `detailed` one with the full details of OpenAI response!
- Last but not least, you can keep track of the number of tokens you're using (more information [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them)) when chatting with the model!
